# 🛒 SmartRetail.AI – Autonomous Retail Insights & Assistant

*A multi-agent AI system for small retailers powered by Agent Development Kit & Google Cloud*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**SmartRetail.AI** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help small retail store owners automate their daily business insights, restocking suggestions, and customer query handling using multiple collaborating agents.

Built with **Agent Development Kit (Python)** and deployed on **Google Cloud**, this project demonstrates the power of autonomous multi-agent systems in real-world retail use cases.

## 🧠 Problem

Small retail shops struggle with:

* Manual sales & inventory tracking
* Delayed restock decisions
* No actionable daily insights
* Inability to handle customer queries at scale

---

## 💡 Solution

We built a **multi-agent system** that:

1. Collects and processes sales/inventory data
2. Detects trends, alerts, and product recommendations
3. Generates auto-summarized visual reports
4. Responds to FAQs via a chat interface (WhatsApp/Telegram ready)
